# Theatre Project

I have made the theatre project for all the api points which was said, and all the api call are:

# Api call

<h3>1. Occupy seat - [Endpoint URL - /occupy/ ]</h3>
<p><strong>=></strong> This url is used for occupying the seat as we have to pass 2 argument and those argument will have name and ticket id. So if there is a capacity then only you will be able to occupy the seat other wise you won't..</p>

<h3>2. Vacate seat - [Endpoint URL - /vacate/ ]</h3>
<p><strong>=></strong>  This endpoint takes the seat number which the person will be vacating and frees that slot up to be used by other people.</p>

<h3>3. Get Person/Seat information - [Endpoint URL - /get_info/]</h3>
<p><strong>=></strong> This endpoint can take either the seat number or person’s name or ticket ID for the input and returns the person’s name, ticket ID, and slot number.</p>
<br>

# Additional Notes

<p>These additional notes are very important,So do check it !!</p>

<h3>1. Max Occupancy:</h3>
<p>I have specified this variable in settings.py, so if anyone wants to change the capacity, we can do it..  </p>

<h3>2. Theatre App Url Patterns:</h3>
<p>I have created a specific urls.py file for my app routes so later on if we add new apps then it won't be that messy..</p>

<h3>3. No Front-end :(</h3>
<p>This project does not contain any html page. If front-end would have allowed then I would have made this too good</p>

# Thank you
